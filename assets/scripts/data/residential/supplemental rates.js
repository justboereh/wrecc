        text: 'The per kWh rate on SRS accounts is the same as the rate currently charged on those meters - the General Service 1 rate (GSA1). However, because residential rates are currently not subject to state sales tax, those eligible for the SRS will see a sales tax savings due to the reclassification.',

If the shop and house are on the same property - even if it's separated by a road - then the shop will qualify.

A garage or storage building on a piece of property without a house is classified under the General Service 1 (or GSA 1) rate. In order to comply with TVA's requirements for the SRS, applications on a separate property from your home must remain in the GSA rate.",
